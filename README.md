# JobApplictionApp

## Requirements=
- [.NET SDK 9.0.100](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Running the App
Clone down the repo and run the start-dev.bat

If not running on a microsoft system you can also open the api folder in a termanal and run the following command:
"dotnet run"

And then open the client and run the following:
"npm i"
"ng serve"

## Assumptions/Decisions

- Unfortunately as I was low on time, I did not implement the pagenator, this is something that I have plenty of experience with and could happil;y talk through the steps to do this if required.
- I also ran out of time to implement some additional UI/UX choices and because of this editing a Job Application might seem impossible, but simply click on the table row of the job you wish to edit.
- Again, this is not my dest UI/UX design but to favor submitting this, this is still better then some legacy software I have used :)
